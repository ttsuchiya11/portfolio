      <p>Hi, I’m Taiyo. I’m a recent finance grad currently trying to figure out what to do with my life (and trying to
        find a job). In the meantime, I built this site as a place to share the things I’m genuinely interested in.</p>

      <p>I like taking data and information and turning them into systems. That can be dashboards, trackers, or small
        apps that help me see how things connect and make sense of the bigger picture. Most of the things you’ll find
        lean personal, mostly fun projects rather than polished apps but I’d still love any feedback you might have.</p>

      <p>I also have a <a href="https://taiyotsuchiya.substack.com" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">Substack</a> where I write about tech, project updates, and anything else that I
        find interesting at the time. If you’re looking for a more polished side of me, you can find that on <a
          href="https://linkedin.com/in/ttsuchiya" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

      <p>At the end of the day, this site is a shelf dedicated to the mess of projects and ideas that are in my head.
        Putting them out here and seeing what happens. Ideally, it’s a way to meet other like-minded people who enjoy
        building cool things on the internet.</p>

      <p>Thanks for stopping by,<br>
        Taiyo</p>
