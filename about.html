    <div class="content">
      <p>Hey, I'm Taiyo — a recent business graduate with a background in finance and a deep interest in design,
        technology, and systems thinking. I'm drawn to projects that blend creativity and logic — where form meets
        function and ideas turn into things you can touch or experience.</p>

      <p>Over the past few years, I've explored how data, design, and storytelling intersect — from studying markets and
        building financial models to designing interfaces and experimenting with prototypes. I love figuring out how
        systems connect and how small details shape the bigger picture.</p>

      <p>I'm currently based in Tokyo, finding rhythm between creative work, long-term projects, and personal growth.
        Whether it's building tools, learning something new, or crafting something meaningful, I'm always looking for
        ways to make ideas real.</p>

      <p>This site is my home base — a space to collect, create, and connect the dots as I keep learning and building.
      </p>
